## Project Overview

Corner Grocer Tracker, was developed to help a grocery store analyze daily customer purchases. It reads a list of purchased items from a text file, counts the frequency of each item, and provides options for users to search individual item frequencies, view all item counts, and display a histogram. The program helps solve a real-world problem: understanding customer buying habits to better organize store layout and stock inventory efficiently.

## What I Did Well

I believe I did particularly well in implementing clean, organized code using object-oriented principles. The separation of logic into a `CornerGrocerTracker` class helped keep the code modular and maintainable. I also added user-friendly features like input validation and menu loops to improve usability.

## Areas for Improvement

If I were to enhance the project, I would focus on improving file input error handling. For example, the program could check whether the input file exists and alert the user if it fails to open. I would also improve the output formatting in the histogram for better readability and maybe allow case insensitive item searches.

## Challenges and Solutions

The biggest challenge was ensuring the histogram output was clear and readable for items with high frequency counts. I resolved this by going over each item and printing asterisks based on its frequency. I relied on basic debugging and reference resources like my class notes and previous assignements.

## Transferable Skills

From this project, I gained hands-on experience with file I/O, using maps to manage key-value pairs, input validation, and basic user interface design through a console menu. These skills are directly transferable to other programming projects.

## Code Quality and Maintenance

To keep the code readable and maintainable, I used clear variable names, added comments. I also followed consistent formatting. 

## Final Thoughts

This project helped me understand object-oriented design. It allowed me to build a complete and functional application from start to finish. I look forward to applying these skills in my future coursework and software development projects.
